## THE THREAD (7 tweets)

---

**1/7 — HOOK** (242 chars)

We're looking for 100 people who care about multisig security.

Not 1,000. Not "unlimited early access." Exactly 100.

Lifetime perks. Soulbound NFT. Governance rights. A permanent seat at the table.

The SandGuard Founders Program is open 🧵

---

**2/7 — CONTEXT** (240 chars)

Quick context: SandGuard is a transaction firewall for Safe multisig wallets.

Decodes calldata. Simulates outcomes. Scores risk with AI.

Built after ByBit lost $1.43B to blind signing.

Now we want 100 users to help shape what comes next.

---

**3/7 — BENEFITS** (242 chars)

What every SandGuard Founder gets — for life:

🛡️ Pro access forever (no subscription, ever)
🏆 Soulbound Founder NFT (#1-100) on Base
💎 50,000 $UMBRA tokens
🗳️ Governance votes on the roadmap
⚡ Priority support + early access to everything

---

**4/7 — GENESIS 10** (270 chars)

The first 10 Founders — "Genesis 10" — get extra perks:

✦ Double token allocation (100K $UMBRA)
✦ Quarterly strategy calls with the builder
✦ Featured profile on the Founders page
✦ Unique gold-tier NFT variant

Only 10 Genesis spots. Then that tier closes forever.

---

**5/7 — HOW TO QUALIFY** (235 chars)

How to qualify:

1. Sign up free at supersandguard.com
2. Add your Safe multisig address
3. Analyze 3 transactions
4. Stay active for 7 days

Want in faster? $20 one-time = instant Founder status.

Both humans and AI agents qualify. 🤖

---

**6/7 — PHILOSOPHY** (273 chars)

Why give away lifetime access to 100 people?

Because the first 100 users of a security product ARE the product.

Your feedback shapes the roadmap. Your votes decide features. Your trust is worth more than any subscription.

Founders aren't customers — they're co-builders.

---

**7/7 — CTA** (221 chars)

100 spots total. No Round 2. No exceptions.

When #100 claims their spot, the program closes permanently.

If you care about multisig security — before it's obvious everyone should — this is your seat.

## POSTING STRATEGY NOTES

### Timing
- **Post 2-3 days AFTER Thread A + B** — avoid audience fatigue from 3 threads in one day
- **Best window:** Thu-Fri, 14:00-16:00 UTC (US+EU overlap, "what should I do this weekend" energy)
- **Alt window:** Monday 15:00 UTC (fresh week, decision-making mode)

### Why This Angle Works After A + B
- Thread A (ByBit) established **the problem** — blind signing is killing people
- Thread B (builder) established **the builder** — who's making SandGuard and why
- Thread C (Founders) is **the ask** — now that they understand the problem and the builder, invite them in
- This is a classic awareness → credibility → conversion funnel across 3 threads

### Thread Mechanics
- Space tweets 3-5 min apart for algorithm visibility
- Reply to tweet 1 (not quote-tweet) to keep the thread connected
- Pin tweet 1/7 if it gains traction
- After full thread is posted, add a reply with just the link: `supersandguard.com`

### Engagement Strategy
- After posting, QT tweet 6/7 (the philosophy one) with a personal comment like "This is the part I care about most"
- Like and reply to EVERY response in the first 2 hours — algorithm rewards early engagement
- If anyone asks questions, answer in detail (builds trust + thread visibility)
- DM people who engage positively and mention they run a Safe — offer to walk them through signup

### Visual Suggestions
- **Tweet 1:** Clean graphic — "100 Founders. Lifetime Access. One Chance." on dark background with SandGuard shield
- **Tweet 3:** Benefits card — emerald/dark design showing all 6 perks with icons
- **Tweet 4:** "Genesis 10" gold-accented card, feels premium and scarce
- **Tweet 7:** Minimal brand card — just the SandGuard logo + supersandguard.com

### Hashtag Strategy
- DON'T spam hashtags — max 1-2 in the final tweet only
- Good options: #BuildOnBase #MultisigSecurity
- The content should speak for itself; hashtags are secondary

### Cross-Promotion
- Share tweet 1 link on Moltbook with context for AI agent audience
- Post a condensed version on Farcaster/Warpcast
- If Thread A or B got engagement, QT from those audiences: "If you liked [Thread A/B], here's how to get involved"

### Key Differentiators from Thread A + B
- Thread A: **no CTA to buy/join** — pure education
- Thread B: **soft CTA** — "DMs open, check it out"
- Thread C: **direct CTA** — "here's exactly how to join, here's what you get, here's the deadline"
- Escalating commitment across threads mirrors how trust is built

### Risk Notes
- Don't overhype — the tone should be "we're building something real and want real users" not "LAST CHANCE 🚀🚀🚀"
- The "AI agents qualify" angle (tweet 5) is genuinely novel — lean into it but don't make it weird
- If someone pushes back on the NFT/token angle, respond honestly: "The NFT is soulbound proof of early adoption, not a speculative asset. The tokens vest over 6 months because we want Founders who stick around."
