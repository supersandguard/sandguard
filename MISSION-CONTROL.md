## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Subagents that think too much fail.** pricing-tiers-v1 burned 111K tokens thinking without executing. Fix: give concrete, step-by-step instructions.
2. **Browser tool doesn't work in subagents.** ux-audit v1 failed. Fix: use web_fetch instead.
3. **Railway doesn't auto-deploy on git push** unless connected to GitHub. Fix: manual `railway up` or fix GitHub integration.
4. **Frontend builds are heavy** (~200MB deps). Pi can't build locally. All builds must happen on Railway.
5. **Always check if a deploy actually happened** — verify bundle hash changed.

## 🔗 Reference

- **Agent Squad article:** https://x.com/pbteja1998/status/2017662163540971756 (2.3M views)
- **Key pattern:** Shared task DB + staggered heartbeats + WORKING.md + SOUL per agent
- **Our adaptation:** Single main agent with spawned subagents (simpler, no persistent multi-agent)
